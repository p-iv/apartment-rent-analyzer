# Apartment Offer Alert 

An automated, real-time web scraping and data analysis system designed to monitor the real estate market (Otodom) for rental apartments. The application automatically detects new listings, calculates market price averages using an internal database, filters out price anomalies, and instantly sends automated alerts via a Telegram bot.

## Project Architecture & Workflow

1. **Scraper Engine:** Boots up every 15 minutes.
2. **Database Verification:** Checks if the scraped URL exists in the main pipeline.
3. **Data Analysis:** If the entry is new, the system triggers `SELECT AVG(price_per_m2) FROM apartments` to fetch the real-time average.
4. **Conditional Routing:** * The entry is saved into the master `apartments` table.
   * If `current_price_per_m2 < market_avg * 0.85`, it is copied into the `valuable_offers` table and triggers an immediate high-priority Telegram push.
5. **Sleep Sequence:** The process safely closes database connections and enters sleep cycle.
